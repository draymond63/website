      <h3>Philosophy</h3>
      <p>
        The overarching mentallity I've adopted has been to understand the root of 
        everything. This is the cause for my passion in all branches of my life.
      </p>
      <h3>Engineering</h3>
      <p>
        I am a Systems Design Engineering student at the <a>University of Waterloo!</a> 
        Although it is a very broad program, I would say I specialize in hardware 
        and software. I am proficient in Python, C, and System Verilog
      </p>
      <h3>Acting </h3>
      <p>
        I recently organized and hosted a student-run threatre festival with plays, 
        a magician, musical acts, and improv. I have also wrote a play and <a>directed</a>, 
        acted, and ran audio for the entire show. I intend to audition for theatres 
        in Kitchener Waterloo once this whole pandemic blows over.
      </p>
      <h3>Frisbee</h3>
      <p>
        This past year I played Ultimate Frisbee on the <a>varsity</a> team for UW.
