    <h3>Philosophy</h3>
    <p>The overarching mentallity I've adopted has been to understand the root of everything. This is the cause for my passion in all branches of my life.</p>
    <h3>Engineering</h3>
    <p>I am a Systems Design Engineering student at the University of Waterloo! Although it is a very broad program, I would say I specialize in hardware and software. I am proficient in Python, C, and System Verilog</p>
    <h3>Acting </h3>
    <p>I recently organized and hosted a student-run threatre festival with plays, a magician, musical acts, and improv. I have also wrote a play and directed, acted, and ran audio for an entire show. I intend to audition for theatres in Kitchener Waterloo.</p>
    <h3>Frisbee</h3>
    <p>This past year I played Ultimate Frisbee on the varsity team for UW.</p>
