# My Personal Website!
Someone interested in the source code? Well, this website has been
through a lot. 

### The first iteration
This was built in React in 2017. But, due to my stubborness at the time,
I used no libraries - no JQuery, Routers - nothing. So, all the routing
was done by hand and thus the website was incredibly rigid, not mobile
friendly, and horribly designed (due to my previous hatred for scrolling).

### The second one
This was built in March of 2020 using pure HTML CSS and Javascript. 
I had the idea of having a 2D physics environment with screens falling down
into view, and users being able to swipe them away. Cannon JS was the best
library I could find, but it was always paired with ThreeJS. So, I decided
to make my own 2D render engine that took in the coordinates of Cannon physics
objects. It worked, but not being able to scroll made things difficult for CSS,
and I once again chose horrible colours. 

### The current one
This was built in 5 days in May of 2020 with Vue. The original design was from a
lovely friend of mine name Jayden (jaydenhsiao.me) and was so much easier to implement
when compared to the previous iterations. Although, its ease was probably due to 
the fact that I finally understood the languages as opposed to hacking my way through
problems.
