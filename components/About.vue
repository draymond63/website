		<h2>About Me</h2>
		<h3>I like a lot of things :)</h3>
		<img src="@/assets/Venn.svg" alt="A venn diagram of my interests">
		<h4>Engineering</h4>
		<p>
			I am currently working at <b>SpaceX</b> as a Starship Avionics Intern and
			as mentioned I am studying engineering at UWaterloo.
			In the future I hope to work either in the Aerospace industry (like SpaceX)
			or in the humanitary tech sector (like Zipline or Demine Robotics).
		</p>
		<h4>Acting</h4>
		<p>
			I love theatre! Those who know me in person would likely consider me
			a pretty loud and extroverted person (and they'd be right ¯\_ (ツ)_/¯).	
			In 2019 I organized and hosted a student-run threatre festival with plays, 
			a magician, musical acts, and improv. In it I wrote, directed, acted, and
			ran audio!
		</p>
		<h4>Philosophy</h4>
		<p>
			My brothers are (admittedly) a very large influence. As a result, I have
			begun to appreciate Philosophy, particularily because it helps me realize
			why I have the assumptions I do. I have currently taken three Philosophy
			courses and hope to finish my degree with a Philosophy minor.
		</p>
		<h4>Sports</h4>
		<p>
			Frisbee is my sport of choice - I was on the varsity team pre-covid and
			have been playing casually ever since. Recently, I've been enjoying beach
			volleyball (in LA!) and spikeball as well. Reach out if you ever want to 
			play :)
